Now I'll be working on it ...

my challenges

1- Automate the backup of the store's tax files with python.

2- Create a log file and display it on a web page in the form of cards.

3- use the OS module to check existing files

Remembering ... I'm just a developer I still don't know the advanced ideas, but I intend to learn.
